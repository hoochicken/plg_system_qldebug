# qldebug 

qldebug is especially for devs working on a website trying to fix it.

Sometimes there is no ftp access, so it is hard to see, what objects are used, what is written in them, if post or session data are existing.

That is when qldebug helps by offering to display following data:

* $_POST
* $_GET
* $_SERVER
* $GLOBALS
* $_FILES
* $_REQUEST
* $_SESSION
* $_COOKIE
* JInput object
* JUser object
* JApplication object
* info concerning a defined table (columns, data)
* list of files included

* You can choose, if you want to show the data always, only to a user logged in or only to a Super User or not at all.

PS: You need/want more options? Just contact me, I'm glad for any new ideas concerning this module:-)
